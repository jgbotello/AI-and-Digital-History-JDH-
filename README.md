# Abstract
Recent advances in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) are reshaping historical research by enabling new ways to access, process, and interpret archival materials. Our digital history study investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist in reconstructing migratory movements from Ottoman Empire–era census registers (referred to throughout as defters). The analysis of these records has traditionally been a complex task due to their linguistic, structural, and temporal inconsistencies, including transliteration ambiguities, non-standardized formats, historical toponyms, and differing calendar systems. We show to what extent GPT-4o can extract, format, and geolocate historical geographic data, as well as perform Hijri to Gregorian calendar conversions. We systematically compared LLM outputs against modern geolocation and date conversion tools such as Geopy and an online date converter via application programming interface (API). GPT-4o outperformed Geopy in geolocating historical place names by nearly 40%. Temporal validation showed that the LLM correctly converted 97% of years but struggled with month and day conversion. Using the resulting data, we analyzed migratory movements and patterns. Our findings highlight both the opportunities and methodological challenges of applying generative AI to historiography, offering a foundation for future AI-assisted workflows in digital history research and education.
